## Becuase of CoinMarketCap restriction of making request with javascript, i used hard coded data from their service, and mimic API calls as a prove of concept, also i left function which calls API in code but not using them.

### Note: Making HTTP requests on the client side with Javascript is currently prohibited through CORS configuration.
